### PochiVM -- lightweight framework for easy and efficient code generation
------
PochiVM is a JIT (just-in-time) code-generation framework backed by LLVM and a novel baseline compiler. 
<!--
JIT code-generation, the technique of compiling user logic (e.g. a SQL query, or a Javascript snippet) into native binary code on-the-fly, offers drastically improved performance compared with traditional interpretative approach, and is widely used in applications from SQL servers to web browsers. However, the steep learning curve of LLVM, and the large gap between "*what the low-level LLVM APIs provide*" and "*what a high-level application needs*" might have prevented many developers from trying it. 
-->
The goal of PochiVM is to enable any ordinary C++ user with no prior knowledge of LLVM or code-generation to enjoy the benefits of code-generation technology. It provides:
 - **Intuitive C-like language interface** to describe the logic of the generated code. Most of the core C language constructs, and certain C++ features including `constructor`/`destructor`/`scoped variable`/`exception` are supported. You write generated code just like you write the same logic in C/C++.
 - **Seamless and efficient interaction** with your C++ codebase. The generated program can access any C++ classes and functions using an intuitive syntax, even if they are templated, overloaded, virtual, or have non-primitive parameter/return types. Moreover, calls to C++ functions **can be inlined** into generated code, allowing the mix of C++ infrastructure and generated code with minimal overhead. 
 - **Novel baseline compiler**. LLVM compilation produces good code, but incurs a high startup delay. We implemented a baseline compiler based on the novel copy-and-patch technique, that compiles the program in a negligble time similar to interpreters, but generates better code than LLVM -O0. This is important for complex applications (e.g., databases) that generates large programs at runtime.  
 - You write everything in completely valid C++ code. No fragile external text-preprocessor magic or C macro magic involved. Even IDE code hinting works (provided a decent IDE like QtCreator).
 - **User-friendly error handling**. Almost all static type errors will be caught by `static_assert`. Like C, all programming errors are caught when you compile the generated-code, never at execution phase.

### License

The ultimate goal of this project is to make the world a better place. While a restrictive license may reduce certain misuses that contradict our values, we believe software license is not the best solution to such problems. 

Therefore, PochiVM is licensed under the same permissive license as LLVM ("[Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions](https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/LICENSE.TXT)"). We, however, humbly request you to consider refrain from using the software for projects that cause harm to the world.

### Toy Example
In this example, We will codegen a function that takes a `std::vector<int>*` as parameter, and returns the number of distinct positive values in the vector. The generated function will construct a `std::set<int>` on the stack, then iterate through the vector and insert the positive values into the set, and finally return the `size()` of the set. We will demonstrate the basic language constructs, and the seamless interaction between C++ codebase (in this case, the C++ STL, a heavily templated libary) and the generated code. 

```cpp
// Our name and prototype for the generated function.
const char* funcName = "count_distinct_positive_values";
using FnPrototype = int(*)(std::vector<int>*);

// Create a function 'fn' of given prototype and name, with 'v' binding to its first parameter.
auto [fn, v] = NewFunction<FnPrototype>(funcName);
// Create a local variable of type 'std::set<int>'.
// It is not constructed yet -- this is just to specify its type and allow us to cite it later.
auto s = fn.NewVariable<std::set<int>>();
// Create a local variable of type 'std::vector<int>::iterator'
auto it = fn.NewVariable<std::vector<int>::iterator>();

// Create the body of the function
fn.SetBody(
  // Declare and construct local variable 's': default constructor of std::set<int> is called.
  Declare(s),
  // Write a for-loop -- the syntax is almost identical to C++.
  // We invoked C++ methods 'begin()', 'end()' and the overloaded operators '!=', '++'. 
  // We also constructed the variable 'it' using 'v->begin()': C++17 guaranteed-copy-elision
  // will happen. As you can see, the syntax and behavior is "just as if" you were writing C++.
  For(Declare(it, v->begin()), it != v->end(), it++).Do(
    // Write a if-statement, again the syntax is almost identical to C++.
    If(*it > Literal<int>(0)).Then(
      // Unlike C++, we disallow implicitly discarding return values.
      // We explicitly ignore the return value of 'set<int>::insert' using 'IgnoreRet'.
      IgnoreRet(s.insert(*it))
      // Call to 'insert' may throw -- don't worry, the exception will just propagate to the 
      // caller, and all local variables will be destructed, just as you would expect in C++.
    )
  ),
  // Variable 'it' is declared in the for-loop, and at this point it goes out of scope.
  // As you would expect in C++, its destructor will be automatically called at this point. 
  
  // std::set<int>::size() returns 'size_t', while this function returns 'int'. 
  // Both unsigned-to-signed conversion and narrowing conversion are potentially unsafe,  
  // so we require an explicit static_cast for such type conversions.
  Return(s.size().StaticCast<int>())
  // After the return statement, 's' also goes out of scope, and will be destructed.
);

// Validate that the module contains no errors. If an error is detected, 
// human-readable error message can be retrieved in thread_errorContext->m_errorMsg 
TestAssert(ValidateModule());
// Build the module, and retrieve the built function
BuildModule();
FnPrototype generatedFn = GetFunction<FnPrototype>(funcName);

// Invoke the generated function
std::vector<int> vec { -1, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2 };
printf("The vector contains %d distinct positive values.", generatedFn(&vec));  // outputs 2
```

Thanks to the inlining feature, the generated code will be just as efficient as writing the same logic in C++: the calls to the cheap C++ methods (constructors, destructors, `begin()`, `end()`, `std::vector<int>::iterator`'s overloaded `*`, `!=` and `++` operators, etc) will be inlined, and after they are inlined, LLVM optimizer will be able to figure out that `v->end()` is a loop invariant and will only evaluate it once. In the end, you will get the same optimized binary code as you can get by writing the same logic in C++.

Of course, the above example is not really useful -- all logic of the generated function is already known at compile time, so you could have implemented it in C++ directly. However, if the logic is only known at runtime (for example, a SQL engine executing a query from user, or a web browser executing a Javascript snippet on a website), being able to JIT-compile the user logic into native binary code would often be much faster than an interpretative approach.

### Q & A

Q: What types can be used in generated code?

A: There are a few notable limitations in the typesystem, made by intentional design decisions to trade a bit expressiveness for simplicity.
 - The typesystem does not have the concept of `const`-ness or `volatile`-ness. 
 - The typesystem does not support C++11 rvalue-reference type.
 - The typesystem only supports rvalue non-fundamental type (temporary objects) in a few well-defined cases, mostly for interaction with C++ codebase. This is to make the behavior of the code straightforward (no hidden constructor/move constructor/destructors behind the scene due to temporary objects). It also greatly simplifies the implementation and cases needed to test.
 - The generated function's prototype may only have fundamental-typed parameters and return values.
 
Q: Any limitations in accessing C++ infrastructure from generated code?

A: The limitations in the generated code's typesystem have a few direct implications.
 - Since the generated code's typesystem does not have `const`-ness, the`const`-qualifier is ignored in all parameters and return value. For example, if a C++ function returns `const int* const**`, it would become a `int***` in the generated code's typesystem. It is your responsibility to make sure the generated code would not write into unwritable memory.
 - `volatile`-qualifier, and C++11 rvalue-reference is not supported. You cannot call C++ function which parameters or return value contain such types (using them inside the C++ function is completely fine though).
 - Since the generated code's typesystem does not have `const`-ness, the generated code cannot distinguish between overloaded C++ function prototypes that only differs in `const`-ness. One common example is class member `Getter`s, E.g., `const int* SomeClass::Get() const` vs `int* SomeClass::Get()`: you can only make one of them accessible to generated code.

Q: The naming conventions and macros remind me of the codebase in M***QL.

A: Just to clarify any potential concerns, none of the code in this repo was written while I was affiliated to there. I never worked on their internal codegen framework, nor am I aware of any of their design/implementation choices or technical detail. All code in this repo are either independently written by me, or publicly available on the Internet and properly cited if applicable.

Q: What does the name 'PochiVM' mean?

A: 'Pochi' is a Japanese word that means 'Mini' (amongst other meanings). I named it for two reasons:
 - The framework is a bit higher-level than LLVM ("Low-Level Virtual Machine"), but still not so high-level that limits the potential use case. 
 - Design decisions are made with a spirit of minimalism: to provide a minimal set of intuitive APIs while still being expressive enough for complex applications.
